\chapter{Results}

A complete description of the results produced !!
\section{The Prevalence of AGN activity in BCGs}
Describe how the evidence of the data analysis we conducted leads to the description of BCGs in a confrontation to non-BCGs, and in how different is still from a pure optical view the response of the AGN feedback.

Present absolutely the Table with all of the percentage ( and the counting ) values of the populations of both BPT NII and BPT SII diagnostics and introduce a confrontation with also the results found in Vitale et AL and others.

\section{The Radio activity of BCGs}
Explain the evidences found in the analysis and possible ways to improve results obtained.

There's certainly also the need to add a discussion on how it is possible that we ignore some of the BCGs in the counting, issue that should be resolved by choosing a more complete source of data regarding Radio Emitters galaxies.
