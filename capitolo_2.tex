\chapter{Methods}

\section{Data Description}
A description of the Data Samples Utilized, and its peculiarities, starting from The SDSS DR7 description, and following the work provided by the MPA-JHU team.
\section{Data Analysis}
How we analyzed the data, where do we defined the fractions calculated ?
\subsection{Optical analysis}
Describe each population of the BPT diagram and its peculiarities, before starting the description of how we collected and processed the data to finally create BPT diagrams .
Finally there's the need to explain how we interpreted the diagrams to finally calculate the fractions ( in this case you need to explain which algorithm has been chosen and why ) 


\subsection{Radio Analysis}
I certainly need to focus on how i have chosen the range of identification, to recognize which element of sdss was effectively recognized as a Radioloud.

Following to this it is necessary to explain how we selected the elements in which define the fractions, by selecting elements of SDSS nearby the location in which best et al finds mostly its radio-emitting elements!
